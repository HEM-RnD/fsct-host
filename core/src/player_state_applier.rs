// Sketch: An alternative async queue-based applier could look like this (not used by default):
// - It owns an mpsc::Sender<Command> and spawns a worker task that processes commands.
// - PlayerManager would only enqueue (non-blocking) and return.
// This allows isolating device IO and applying backpressure. Left out for minimal code changes.
