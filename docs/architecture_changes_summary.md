# Architecture Changes Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the architectural changes to the FSCT Host project, specifically the removal of the Player implementation from the Driver Service and its relocation to the User Service.

## Key Changes

1. **Player Implementation Relocation**
   - Player implementations for Windows and macOS are moved from the Driver Service to the User Service
   - Only PlayerState data structures remain in the Driver Service
   - Player Watch component is removed entirely

2. **Architectural Simplification**
   - Player Manager now directly manages PlayerState objects
   - Device Watch focuses solely on device discovery and management
   - Clearer separation between Driver and User Service responsibilities

3. **Communication Flow Changes**
   - User Service now monitors OS-level player state changes
   - User Service sends player state updates to Driver Service
   - Driver Service routes updates to appropriate devices

## Implementation Details

### Driver Service Changes

1. **Removed Components**
   - `player_watch.rs` module is removed
   - Player implementation and PlayerInterface trait are removed from `player.rs`
   - DevicesPlayerEventApplier is no longer needed

2. **Modified Components**
   - `player.rs` retains only data structures (PlayerState, TrackMetadata) and event handling
   - `lib.rs` updated to reflect new module structure
   - `service_entry.rs` and `service_state.rs` updated to use Player Manager instead of Player Watch

3. **Added Components**
   - `player_manager.rs` module added to manage player registrations and device assignments

### User Service Changes

1. **Added Components**
   - Platform-specific player implementations (Windows, macOS)
   - OS-level player monitoring
   - Communication channel with Driver Service

2. **Responsibilities**
   - Detecting and monitoring system players
   - Extracting player state information
   - Sending player state updates to Driver Service

## API Changes

The Driver Service API remains largely unchanged, but the implementation behind it is different:

1. **Unchanged APIs**
   - Player registration and management
   - Player-device assignment
   - Player state updates

2. **Implementation Changes**
   - Player state updates now come from User Service instead of internal Player Watch
   - Player Manager directly routes updates to devices

## Migration Path

1. **For Driver Service**
   - Remove Player Watch component
   - Implement Player Manager
   - Update service initialization

2. **For User Service**
   - Implement platform-specific player detection
   - Create communication channel with Driver Service
   - Send player state updates to Driver Service

## Benefits

1. **Clearer Architecture**
   - Better separation of concerns
   - More intuitive component responsibilities
   - Simplified data flow

2. **Improved Maintainability**
   - Fewer components with clearer responsibilities
   - Reduced redundancy
   - Better testability

3. **Enhanced Flexibility**
   - Easier to add new player implementations
   - Better support for platform-specific features
   - Clearer extension points
